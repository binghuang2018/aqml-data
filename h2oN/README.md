# Computational methods

- Pople basis 6-31g(d) was used throughout

- Molecules under folders hf/, b3lyp/ and mp2 were optimized at levels of 
  theory hf/6-31g(d), b3lyp/6-31g(d) and mp2/6-31g(d), respectively.
  For molecules in folder cc2/ (i.e., ccsd(t)), single points energies were
  calculated based on mp2 geometries.

- All calculations were carried out by Gaussian 09, except for cc2 single 
  point energies, for which Molpro2018 was used.
