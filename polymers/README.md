# Names of the compounds
- 01: PE, polyethylene
- 02: PA, polyacetylene
- 03: (ala)10, alanine peptide
- 04: PLA, polyactic acid
- 05: bQAPS, backbone of quaternary ammonium polysulphone

# Computational methods

- Very difficult to converge geometry by ORCA4, use Gaussian 09 instead for optimzation of geometry (optg)
- Level of theory for optg: BV5LYP/cc-pVDZ
